# FileCompressorDecompressor

The main objective of this File Compression project is to design a compression GUI which significantly reduces the size of a file so that it can be easily shared over mail even in slow internet speed. This GUI works in the same way as the winrar and winzip, which are popular compression tools. Each byte of the file will be compressed and takes quite less memory on the disk.In this project

Made a GUI to compress a txt file into a gzip file and decode the encoded text file (compressed into gzip file).

Was able to compress a file of size 2668 kb to 5kb.

Used java awt and java swing to design a GUI.

Java Swing and awt
AWT and Swing are used to develop window-based applications in Java. Awt is an abstract window toolkit that provides various component classes like Label, Button, TextField, etc., to show window components on the screen. All these classes are part of the Java.awt package.

On the other hand, Swing is the part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) built on the top of AWT and written entirely in Java . The javax.swing API provides all the component classes like JButton, JTextField, JCheckbox, JMenu, etc.

The components of Swing are platform-independent, i.e., swing doesn't depend on the operating system to show the components. Also, the Swing's components are lightweight.

Conclusion
By now Iâ€™m sure you understand exactly how our we can easily compress the file using simple using of function and send it anywhere at slow internet connections and vise versa and also learned about the java awt and java swing ,I hope You all enjoyed reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it!
